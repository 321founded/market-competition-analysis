## Assessment Process

### Phase 1: Dimension Definition (15-30 minutes)
1. Select universal dimensions relevant to market
2. Identify 2-4 market-specific dimensions
3. Define assessment criteria for each dimension
4. Establish evidence standards and sources

### Phase 2: Data Collection (60-90 minutes)
1. Collect evidence systematically for each competitor
2. Use parallel research to maximize efficiency
3. Document sources and confidence levels
4. Note gaps and limitations in available data

### Phase 3: Scoring & Calibration (30-45 minutes)
1. Apply scoring criteria consistently across competitors
2. Calibrate scores to ensure relative accuracy
3. Review outliers and edge cases
4. Document rationale for key assessments

## Quality Assurance
